Badges
------

Badges point to the current status of the different Continuous Integration tools in the ``main`` branch. You can also configure badges to report on other branches, though. Are tests passing? Is the package building properly? Is documentation building properly? What is the quality of the code? Red lights mean something is wrong and you should attend it shortly!

Each platform provide their own badges, and you can modify and emulate the badge strategy in the ``README.rst`` file. Yet, you can further tune the badges style by creating your own personalized badge with `Shields.io`_.

You have noticed already that there is no badge for PyPI. That is because "grafanarmadillo" is deployed at ``test.pypi.org``. You will find also at Shields.io how to add the PyPI badge.
